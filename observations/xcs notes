Environment:
    - attributes and endpoints


Population:
    - Made up of classifiers

Classifer:
    - Rule -> The rule
    - Numerosity
    - Match_Count -> every time a rule matches one attrobute in an environment
    - Correct_Count -> when it matches the attribute and endpoint 

The Process:
    - Assume the population starts at 0
    - For training_instance in environment
        - We find all of the classifiers that have rules that match the data set
        - Matches = all_classifiers that match the training instance
        - correct_set = all classifiers from match_set that have same action as training instance endpoint 
        - Covering - IF there are no classifiers in your population that match your training instance  
        - (Add a classifer into the population that does match the training instance
        - When copying the training instance over then random chance for changing) this is called Covering
    - Subsumption
        - Remove all the classifieries that subsume each other

Deletion
    - Get the max population size by summing up the Numerosity of all of the classifiers in the 

Look into XCS, incorporate this into the structure to improve the fitness.
